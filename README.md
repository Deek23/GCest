# 📦 Rcpp Test

A **CRAN-ready R package template** that integrates the simplicity of **CMake** with the power of **Rcpp**, enabling platform-independent linkage to external C/C++ libraries such as **OpenCL**, **OpenGL**, and others.

> This template streamlines the development of high-performance R packages that rely on native code, without manual environment configuration.

---

## ✨ Highlights

- ✅ Platform-independent configuration and linkage with **CMake**
- ✅ Built `tar.gz` does not have any binaries - everything is compiled at package installation.
- ✅ No manual `Makefile` or environment variable setup required
- ✅ Clean separation of public/private headers in C++
- ✅ Simple Rcpp integration — no need to link Rcpp to the external libraries
- ✅ Example: GPU-accelerated distance matrix using **OpenCL**

📝 **Note:** Public headers (`backend/include`) define C/C++ interfaces compatible with `Rcpp`; they should not include external library headers as `Rcpp` does not link against them. Private headers (`backend/src/internal`) manage actual implementation details, allowing clean abstraction.

## ⚙️ Backend with CMake
The `src/backend` directory is a standalone **CMake** project. It builds a shared library that is automatically linked to the R package.

* Extend linkage easily in `CMakeLists.txt` for OpenCL, OpenGL, etc.

* CMake handles all platform-dependent paths and setup.

## 📂 The `inst` Folder

The `inst/` directory contains runtime resources (e.g., `.cl` kernels). During installation, files from `src/backend/kernels` are copied into `inst/kernels` using the `configure` and `configure.win` scripts.

``````r
# Accessed in R via:
system.file("kernels", package = "CMakeRcppTemplate")
``````

These paths are injected into the shared library at runtime using the `.onLoad` hook (see `R/CMakeRcppTemplate.R`), enabling dynamic loading of external resources like OpenCL kernels or OpenGL shaders.

## 🔗 Rcpp Integration

This template uses **manual `SEXP` wrappers** for each Rcpp function (instead of `[[Rcpp::export]]`) to avoid platform-specific issues:

> On some systems, `enterRNGScope` errors to be undefined in `RcppExports.o` even though it was not used in `RcppExports.cpp` when using auto-generated bindings via `compileAttributes()`.

However, for simplicity, you *may* choose to use `[[Rcpp::export]]` if you're willing to trade off some portability.

📌 **Important**:

- Add `import(Rcpp)` to the top of your `NAMESPACE` file to avoid errors like:

  ```text
  Rcpp_precious_remove not provided by package Rcpp.
  ```

- Manually written R wrappers for `SEXP` functions should defensively check input types, since auto-type checks are not generated without `[[Rcpp::export]]`.

## 📤 Exports

Your package may export:

- `SEXP`-wrapper functions via `Rcpp`
- High-level R functions that internally call C/C++ via `Rcpp`
- High-level R functions that are independent of the C/C++ backend

## 🧪 Example Use Case

This template includes an example GPU-based distance matrix computation via **OpenCL**. No changes are required to Rcpp code when adding new backend libraries — just update the CMake configuration.

## 📚 Resources

- [CMake Documentation](https://cmake.org/documentation/)
- [Rcpp Package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Rcpp)
- [Writing R Extensions](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html)

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. Clone this repository (use `--recursive` option in order to get the OpenCL headers aswell!)
2. Modify the `src/backend/` CMake code and `src/*.cpp` `Rcpp`- and `SEXP`-bindings
3. Add new R functions in the `R/` directory calling your `SEXP`-binding functions
4. Document functions via `Rmarkdown` in `man`
5. Adjust the section `copying kernels` in `configure` and `configure.win` according to your external resources.
6. Build and install using `devtools::install()` or `R CMD INSTALL`
